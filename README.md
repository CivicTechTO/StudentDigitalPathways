**Objective:** This project will provide new ways for students to explore careers and postsecondary education choices. Use your skills, imagination and understanding of student needs to turn existing data sources into new and exciting tools. 
 
**Description:** For many students, finding a job is a key reason to pursuing postsecondary education. However, existing tools and available information is often difficult to navigate and interpret. MAESD is looking for ways to improve linkages between datasets through the creation of a tool(s) that would assist students in deciding career pathways. The available data in this challenge includes:
 
1.  Labour Market Information
New job and replacement forecasts by occupation
Job related tasks and required skills

2.  Institution Information
Institution enrollment size and location
 
3.  Program Options and Student Experience
Student and graduate experience by program
 
4.  Outcomes:
Where graduates work or study and avg. income
Student financial assistance needs and default rates from three institutions
 
**What will it enable?**
 
The data will allow the development of a product(s) that will help students align their skills and postsecondary education choice with student experience, graduate outcomes and labour market demand.
 
What skills can you bring?
Data Science
Web Development
User Experience
Policy Innovation
Imagination
Collaboration
 
Who will use the output?
 
MAESD is currently working on a broader digital strategy for Labour Market Information.  This challenge will inform the development of future tools that emerge from the digital strategy to help Ontarians be able to better plan and prepare for future careers.

Challenge description for the CodeAcross website:
--- 
MAESD has a great deal of employment and education data, but needs your help to re-imagine it for public use!  MAESD wants to create a tool that would help students better understand the educational pathway options available and the corresponding linkages to required occupational skills and labour market demand. In addition, gaining insight on the student educational experience and program outcomes across Ontario will allow students to make informed decisions and expand their choices.
